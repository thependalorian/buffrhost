# Observability Guide

**Status: Placeholder**

This document describes the strategy for monitoring, logging, and tracing for the Buffr Host microservices.

## 1. Logging

- **Strategy**: A centralized logging strategy will be implemented using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a similar cloud-native service (e.g., Google Cloud Logging).
- **Format**: All services will output structured logs in JSON format. Each log entry will include a `service_name`, `trace_id`, and `span_id` to correlate logs with traces.
- **Levels**: Standard log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) will be used.

## 2. Metrics

- **Strategy**: Prometheus will be used for collecting and storing metrics. Each microservice will expose a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.
- **Key Metrics**:
    - **RED Method**: Rate (requests/sec), Errors (error rate), Duration (request latency).
    - **USE Method**: Utilization, Saturation, Errors for system resources (CPU, memory, disk).
    - Business-specific metrics (e.g., orders created, payments processed).
- **Dashboards**: Grafana will be used to create dashboards for visualizing metrics and setting up alerts.

## 3. Tracing

- **Strategy**: Distributed tracing will be implemented using OpenTelemetry.
- **Implementation**: Each service will be instrumented with the OpenTelemetry SDK. The API Gateway will be responsible for initiating traces and propagating the trace context to downstream services.
- **Backend**: Jaeger or Zipkin will be used as the tracing backend to store and visualize traces.

## 4. Alerting

- **Strategy**: Alertmanager (integrated with Prometheus) will be used for alerting.
- **Configuration**: Alerts will be defined for key error conditions, high latency, and resource saturation.
- **Notifications**: Alerts will be sent to a dedicated channel in Slack and to PagerDuty for critical issues.
